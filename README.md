 To set up aplication you must type into a temminal bash 'npm install'.
 this will install any needed node modules as this is a backend node appication.
 
 You also need to set up envirment varibles. To do this you need to create an file called simply '.env' and follow the template in the 'example.env'. This is in order to protect any API keys used in this application and to save them locally.
 
 To start or run the appication you must type 'node index.js' the rest should be in the terminal


 
 Currently the project is in early devlopment and will not be able to do much at this time
